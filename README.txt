==Open Standard for Foodshed Data==
We are building an Open Standard for Foodshed Data.

We need this to help normalize data that we are displaying, 
sharing and contributing. This is a draft specification and we are 
looking for advice from people who work with these different datasets 
on a regular basis to help inform the standard.
