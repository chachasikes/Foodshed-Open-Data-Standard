## Fields

resource_id
Optional. A source of supply for an element in the food system. Should be a unique ID.

resource_name
Required. The name of the resource.

resource_description
Optional. Description of the resource.

resource_type
Optional. A type description of the resource. Standard types exist for certain kinds of resources. Refer to [@TODO] list.

resource_style
Optional. A style description of the resource. Standard styles exist for certain kinds of resources. Refer to [@TODO] list.

resource_url
Optional. Link to the resource.
Optional. The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://,
and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped.
See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description
of how to create fully qualified URL values.

resource_keywords
Optional. A string of comma separated keywords. Should be enclosed by double quotes.

resource_location
Optional. Look to the JSON standard and provide a serialized array for this field.
@TODO The location field is tricky to represent as a single column. Should be
generic for multiple countries, multiple locations, and provide address, lat/lon or WKT data.

resource_email
Optional. Email of the resource.

resource_contact
Optional. Name of person who is point of contact for the resource.

resource_phone
Optional. Phone number of the resource.
@TODO It would really be better if these had types and could be unlimited (like in the JSON standard.)

resource_attributes
Optional. A serialized array of attributes.

# resource_hours
# Optional.
@TODO If we roll farmer's markets in this (vs. food events) we would need to have a 
better time description and make the time & location data match up better. 
Or, the Farmer's Market could be a resource, and its hours could be an event with independent locations.
Reason being, there are some food distributions with multiple locations (or there will be.)

# resource_calendar
# Optional.
@TODO Goes with the hours.
